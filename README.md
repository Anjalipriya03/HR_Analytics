HR Data Analytics portfolio project that deals with HR KPIs like Performance tracking, attrition rate. Project involved cleaning, transforming data and visualizing it to create a dashboard. I have used the MS Excel and Power BI's Query Editor for data cleaning and preprocessing and dashboard as part of Data Analyst(Power BI) track of Datacamp.

Note: The original dataset had more than 80K records which needed to be cleaned first and processed for this portfolio project and only the cleaned dataset of 76K records is present in repository.
Query Editing Tool: "Mircosoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI:
Visualization Tool: "Microsoft Power BI"

## Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query
* Open Excel and connect to your employee attendance data
* Use Power Query to clean and transform the data
* Create a copy template for one sheet in Power Query transformations and apply the same transformations to all sheets
* Apply all necessary cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types
* Create a parameter to select the desired data based on a specific condition
* Encapsulate all steps into a function to be reused for future sheets and data
* Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI

## Exploring and Manipulate Some Data Using DAX Query
* With DAX Query, we can effectively manipulate and analyze the data to provide insights for visulization and identify areas for improvement for HR.
* Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum, calculate, if, switch, divide and Date-time function for exploring some clean data for improve dashboard KPI in PowerBI.
